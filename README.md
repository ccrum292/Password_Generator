The goal of this project was to delevop a webpage capable of generating a strong random password based on user-selected criteria. This web application features dynamically updating HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It, also, features a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
